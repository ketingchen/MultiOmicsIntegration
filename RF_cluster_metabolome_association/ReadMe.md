#### Instructions for querying the association between metabolome compositions and gene co-expression clusters using a combined approach of WGCNA and random forest

##### Input files needed:
1. a single column file that represent the composition of the entire metabolome using a single column of values, e.g., tSNE, first principal component, etc.<br>
2. Gene expression profiles, with each row representing a sample id, and each column represent represent a transcript <br>
<br>
